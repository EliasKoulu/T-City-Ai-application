## Problem

### Intended users
Who are the primary target users of this application?
- Mostly office workers and employees who deal with a lot of paperwork.

### Problem statement
What specific problem does this application solve for those users?
- Reduces huge amounts of manual labor.

### Why AI is appropriate
Why does this problem require AI / LLM capabilities rather than traditional deterministic software?
- Deterministic softwares follow a strict pattern which has been determined and dont have the necessary capabilities to process the documents how the user prefers / wants. This problem can be solved with a document analyzer which hass been trained with an LLM and/or uses AI.

## Solution

Briefly describe your application, its primary value proposition, and how it addresses the problem statement above.
- Our application of choice will be a document comparison tool. It's primary value comes from saving time and automating redundant repetitive tasks. It's for minimizing mistakes which come from repetitiveness and compares the documents on user input/preference.

## Main user workflow

1. **User Input:** The user submits a prompt or query via the Gradio user interface.
2. **Processing & Guardrails:** The application service layer (`src/services/ai_service.py`) validates and formats the request.
3. **Model Response:** The model client calls Ollama locally and returns the response back through the service layer to the UI.

## Architecture

Below is the initial starter architecture. As your project evolves with additional capabilities, replace or extend this diagram in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

```text
User
  ↓
Gradio UI (app/ui.py)
  ↓
Application / AI Service (src/services/ai_service.py)
  ↓
Model Client (src/models/model_client.py)
  ↓
Ollama (Local LLM Server)
```

> **Core Architectural Rule:** The user interface must NEVER communicate directly with the model client or Ollama. All interactions must pass through the service layer (`ai_service.py`).

## Model

- **Model used:**
- **Selection rationale:** 

## Additional AI capability

Select at least one additional capability to implement for your final project:

- [ ] RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- [ ] Tools / External API integration
- [ ] Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- [ ] Agentic workflow (Model-selected actions based on observations)
- [ ] Memory / Persistent state
- [X] Multimodal interaction (Text + Images)
- [ ] Other: ______________________

### Capability justification
Explain why the selected capability is useful and necessary for your application's user problem.
- We've chosen multimodal interaction. We want the final product to be as versatile as possible and able to analyze different file type documents.

## Setup

### 1. Create the Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 2. Activate the environment

```bash
conda activate dev-ai-project
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to create your local `.env` configuration file:

On Linux / macOS:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):
```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

Ensure `.env` contains valid values for `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `MODEL_NAME`:
```env
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
MODEL_NAME=llama3.2
```

### 4. Start Ollama

Make sure Ollama is installed and running locally, then pull your configured model:

```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

### 5. Run the application

Run the application from the root directory of the project:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:7860`.

### 6. Run automated tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Evaluation

Describe your evaluation methodology and summarize key results. Starter test cases can be found in [`evaluation/test_cases.json`](evaluation/test_cases.json).

Refer to [`evaluation/README.md`](evaluation/README.md) for guidelines on defining success, edge cases, and failure scenarios.

## Known limitations

- Highlight known system limitations, unhandled edge cases, or boundaries of current capabilities.

## Future improvements

- List planned feature enhancements, architectural refactorings, or future capabilities.
